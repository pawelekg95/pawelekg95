## PaweÅ‚ Gmurczyk
I am a C++ developer and computer science student (BSc) at the University of Economics and Human Sciences in Warsaw. On a daily basis, I develop and maintain components written in C++ (mostly >= 17) for internal libraries and applications intended for Linux systems. I prioritize code quality and maintainability in my solutions, using a high-level, object-oriented approach to ensure that they are efficient, scalable, and easy to modify. CMake is the build environment of the projects I have contributed to.

In addition to my expertise in C++ development and Linux systems, I have experience with Bash and Python scripting, which I have used to automate tasks. I also have extensive experience with CI/CD practices, including GitLab's built-in CI mechanism and GitHub-actions, and have used them to create automated pipelines that integrate testing, deployment, and monitoring. By leveraging the power of these tools, I can ensure that my code is of the highest quality and meets the strictest standards for performance and security.
